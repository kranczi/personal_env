# personal_env
Personal setup for the following packages:
- tmux
- fish
- xkb
- nvim

More details on specific changes:
- tmux: most important adjustments:
prefix, history-limit, bottom status and pane switching.
this is tightly connected with xkb configuration.
In short, arrow keys are completely unbound.
Moving, resizing is done through i,j,k,l that mirror arrow assignment.

- fish: for now mostly related with powerline and accepting default ctrl-i taken over by xkb mapping.

- xkb: main goal is to improve speed and comfort. Important aim is to keep sane interchangeability of keys mapping between terminal, browser, editor.
