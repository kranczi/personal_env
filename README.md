# personal_env
Personal setup for the following packages:
- tmux
- fish
- xkb
- nvim

tmux:
Most important adjustments:
prefix, history-limit, bottom satus and pane switching.
this is tightly connected with xkb configuration.
In short, arrow keys are completely unbound.
Moving, resizing is done through i,j,k,l that mirrow arrow assignment.

fish:
for now mostly related with powerline and accepting default ctrl-i taken over by xkb mapping.

xkb:
main goal is to improve speed and comfort.
Important aim is to keep sane interchangability of keys mapping between terminal, browser, editor.

nvim:
